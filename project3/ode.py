"""
This module sets up each of the 3 ODEs (forward euler, 2nd-order Runge-Kutta, 
and 4th-order Runge-Kutta). It does this by defining 3 separate functions to 
determine what each ODE does when it is calculated.

"""

# all routines that take a single step should have the same interface
# fEuler is complete, except for documentation. you can use this as a pattern 
# for the other two routines.

    This sets up the forward Euler ODE. It defines it as a function that takes 
    in a function (f), time(t), position (z), time-step (h), and other arguments 
    (args). This function returns the new position (new_z) as z+h*f(t,z,*args).
    
    Arguments
        f(t,z,...)
            function that contains the RHS of the equation dz/dt = f(t,z,...)
    
        t
            the time at which the system is currently at. Only impacts anything
            if f() has a time dependence
        
        h
            the timestep between each run of the method, smaller timesteps will
            result in more accurate results, but increase computation time
    
        args (tuple, optional)

    This sets up the 2nd-order Runge-Kutta by defining it as a function which 
    takes in a function (f), time (t), position (z), time-step (h), and other 
    arguments (args). Inside the function, initial acceleration is calculated 
    (k1z) which is used to find the new acceleration (k2z). The function returns 
    the new position (new_z) as z+k2z*h.
